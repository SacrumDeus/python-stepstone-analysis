Those postcodes cannot be used to identify a city with ARS. For further processing, we need to map the postcode with the community code. Therefore we downloaded a file from DESTATIS, which contains all postcodes and the ARS ([File download](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Laender-Regionen/Regionales/Gemeindeverzeichnis/Administrativ/Archiv/GVAuszugJ/31122020_Auszug_GV.html)). This file is type of XLSX and is malformatted. This file contains multiple pages and many useless data. This file was processed manually to map the data. It was saved as CSV for performance reasons (XLSX input is pretty slow).\n"
